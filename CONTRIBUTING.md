# Contributing to VSCode-Journal
Thank you so much for your interest in contributing! All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. 

## About the Project
I have been writing notes every day for over 10 years and still use this extension all the time. In the beginning only with Notepad and other text editors. When the first version of Visual Studio Code came out, I saw an opportunity to get to know Typescript better and started developing this extension.  That's why I mainly focus on ideas and extensions that help me in my daily work.

The source code reflects this journey. A bit bumpy at the beginning (and still today for sure, all this javascript stuff makes me doubt myself often enough), but it got a bit better with the years. 

## How to contribute

There are several ways to contribute.

* If you find any issues, weird behaviour or plain error, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/pajoma/vscode-journal/issues/new). I try to react timely, but don't count on it. 
* [Start a discussion](https://github.com/pajoma/vscode-journal/discussions/new) if you have question or feature requests. Or see if there are any other unanswered questions you might be able to answer. 
* Leave a review on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pajoma.vscode-journal&ssr=false#review-details) and keep me motivated ;)
* Let me buy a beer by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/pajoma) my work here

If you plan to contribute with updates to the source, follow these steps

* Outline your idea in the discussions. 
* Talk to me on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/dictyo) for further questions. 
* Create a fork, do your thing, and create a pull request. Please write tests if possible. 

## Code of conduct
